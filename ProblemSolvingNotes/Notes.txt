5 Steps of Problem Solving:

1. Understanding the problem statement, Identify and Ask questions.
By the end of this phase an indvidual should be able to ask you questions and you should be able to answer ie edge case etc

2. Coming up with the solution THEORETICALLY no coding only pseudo code / diagrams.

3. CODING! By this time you should. Feel confidant that you can code it up within 5 mins (15-20min realistically).

4. Testing your Code. (Finding the right test case) small ones that demonstrate the input, run time and space complexities

5. Solve / refactor for time / space complexity!
