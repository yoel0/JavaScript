Impossible, declare POSSIBLE.
Cannot, declare CAN.
Disbelief, declare BELIEF.
Doubt, How DARE they. Let them hear us SHOUT.
Hate, invoke LOVE.
Give me your dreams. I will swallow them, digest them and birth them in to reality.
Every scar will build the most beautiful future, they never believed in.
They can beat you down infinitly but they can never take away the smile you and I wear most proudly.
One day they will understand the difference between happiness and misery is only a choice.
-Yoel
